## One identity, every surface

Glyphfield keeps the foundations and the outputs in the same system. Define a
brand once, then use the active identity across 15 focused tools and 66
production touchpoints without rebuilding the context for every artifact.

| Foundation | Expression | Application | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logo family | Motion packages | OpenGraph + social | PNG |
| Color tokens | Live logo shaders | Slides + blog covers | SVG |
| Typography | Dither + grain + gradients | Email + product UI | GIF |
| Voice + positioning | Terminal themes | CLI + documentation | JSON |

The Studio ships with a neutral Starter identity and a complete General
Translation reference system. Project tabs are independent local workspaces;
closing a tab never deletes its brand.

## A design tool that agents can operate

The visual Studio and the public agent interface use the same identities,
catalog, and generation language.

  I[Brand identity] --> S[Studio tools]

  O --> P[Product · Marketing · Docs · Motion]
```

- Humans compose, tune, preview, and download in `/studio`.
- Agents discover capabilities through `/llms.txt`, `/api/agent`, and
  `/openapi.json`.
- `POST /api/generate` produces deterministic SVG templates, backgrounds, and
  identity-aware element briefs.
- Browser projects and uploaded source files stay local; API generation is
  processed in memory and is not persisted.

## Motion studies

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./public/examples/gt-morph-one-second.gif" alt="Centered multilingual morph animation" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./public/examples/gt-type-delete.gif" alt="Multilingual type and delete animation" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Morph / fade</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Type / delete</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Both are generated from the Studio’s reusable animation model: centered text,
configurable hold timing, cubic-bezier transitions, and frame-accurate GIF
export.

## Built for real brand work

- Design boards combine foundations with finished applications and export up
  to 4800 × 6000 PNG.
- Logo Shader combines the supplied ShaderGradient sphere, ten original local
  GLSL recipes based on the visual families cataloged in Ariadne, and Studio materials across live
  backdrops and alpha-masked marks, with still PNG and animated GIF export.
- Background Lab creates gradients, grain, ordered Bayer dithering, dots,
  lines, and grids as portable SVG-composed images.
- Studio appearance persists light or dark mode, accent, canvas density, and a
  choice of Switzer, Be Vietnam Pro, Schibsted Grotesk, or Rethink Sans.
- Templates include fourteen slide layouts plus blog, partnership, OpenGraph,
  terminal, email, and brand-element systems.
- Fumadocs powers 24 feature, artifact, integration, and API guides.
- Landing, Studio, and every documentation page receive generated 1200 × 630
  OpenGraph and Twitter artwork from one shared brand renderer.

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3012](http://localhost:3012). The full workspace is at
`/studio` and the documentation is at `/docs`.

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Generate without the UI

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:3012/api/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "kind": "template",
    "template": "slides",
    "identity": { "preset": "gt" },
    "slideLayout": "title",
    "title": "Code is the source of truth.",
    "output": "raw"
  }' \
  -o gt-slide.svg
```

The API embeds bundled logo assets into generated SVG. Custom agents can send
authorized images as base64 data URLs; Glyphfield never fetches remote asset
URLs.

| Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`/llms.txt`](./public/llms.txt) | Operational agent runbook |
| `/api/agent` | Versioned manifest and generation contract |
| `/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| `/api/catalog` | Structured Studio tool catalog |
| `/api/identities` | Built-in identities and complete GT preset |
| `/api/elements` | Complete brand-element taxonomy |
